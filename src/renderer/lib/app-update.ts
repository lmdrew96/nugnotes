/**
 * Stale-tab update detection.
 *
 * The service worker runs in `prompt` mode: a new build installs in the
 * background and waits until the user chooses to apply it. We never reload on
 * our own — the user may be mid-sentence in their notes.
 *
 * DETECTION is decoupled from the service worker. Workbox only reaches the
 * `waiting` state that fires `onNeedRefresh` after it has precached the entire
 * changed manifest — 15 MB of it here — and browsers only re-check the worker on
 * navigation. Instead we fetch a small `version.json` written at build time and
 * compare it against this bundle's own stamp, which answers in one round trip
 * and kicks the new worker's install immediately. `onNeedRefresh` stays wired as
 * a backstop for when that fetch is unavailable.
 *
 * The toast is held until that install parks in `waiting`, so Refresh is instant
 * when clicked. Offering it earlier made Refresh sit silently for seconds while
 * the download finished, which read as a broken button.
 *
 * APPLICATION is NOT decoupled, and must not be. While the old worker still
 * controls the page, a plain reload is served the old build straight back out
 * of its precache — so the toast's Refresh has to go through the worker, and
 * wait for one to be `waiting` if the install is still in flight.
 *
 * State lives at module level (not in a hook) so registration happens once at
 * startup for every visitor, while the toast that reads it only mounts inside
 * the authenticated layout.
